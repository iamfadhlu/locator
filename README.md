## Introduction

Locator is a web-based tool that leverages the Google Maps Geocoding API to convert user-input addresses into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). It then displays the location on a Google Map, providing a visual representation of the specified address.

## Features

- Geocoding: Enter an address in the input field and click the button to see its geographical coordinates.
- Map Visualization: The application displays a Google Map centered around the geocoded location.
- Dynamic Zoom: The map's zoom level is dynamically adjusted to fit the bounds of the geocoded location.
